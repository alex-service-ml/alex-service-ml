<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Bottom-line up front: I am an ML Engineer with a <strong>strong desire to apply state-of-the-art research to complex problems.</strong> 
Recently, I've been developing a modern data platform and  analytics process to identify and quantify valuable questions for 
both our internal teams and our customers. My primary domain is in computer vision (segmentation/detection/classification), 
but I am looking to build expertise in the domains of reinforcement learning and natural language. I am most comfortable with 
python + pytorch</p>
<hr />
<h2>SKILLS</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: python</li>
<li><strong>Tech Stack</strong>: pytorch, conda/poetry, Azure ML, GCP, docker, git</li>
<li><strong>Development Processes</strong>: Agile, TDSP</li>
<li><strong>Certifications</strong>: Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera), ColumbiaX AI &amp; ML, CCNA, A+</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
<h5>Mile Two</h5>
<p><font size="1">SENIOR MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER (I.E. DATA ENGINEER IN DENIAL), 2018/03 - PRESENT</font></p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized data analysis &amp; development via a cloud-deployable conda environment to reduce spin-up time among the 
Machine Learning team (targeting Azure ML) and improve data/model provenance.   </li>
<li>Demonstrated feasibility of metric and optimization <strong>meta-learning</strong> on customer's imagery dataset for one-shot and 
few-shot scenarios  </li>
<li>Led a team who won 2021 and placed 3rd overall in 2019 Wright Brothers Institute's Swarm and Search AI (SSAI) challenge, 
as well as received an Innovation Award for our team's vision, <strong>incorporating Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> (DDPG) 
into our submission by creating an OpenAI Gym API for the provided simulation software</li>
<li>Incorporated <strong>object detection</strong> into a customer's framework. Particularly, You Only Look Twice (YOLT, a YOLO variant). 
Included building streaming interfaces to feed video to the model, slicing imagery, performing non-max suppression. 
Achieved roughly 11 FPS on 1080p imagery using a consumer-grade GPU. Supported distributing work to multiple local GPUs. </li>
<li>Wrote technical volumes for multiple proposals focused on ML-oriented projects </li>
</ul>
