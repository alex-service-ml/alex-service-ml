title: Goals for 2021
date: 2020-12-09


## Overarching Goals
* [ ] Provide an ML solution that provides value. Value can be either a useful open-source project or a profitable solution.
* [ ] Discover a novel ML approach worth publishing. Publish it.

## Site Goals
* [ ] Provide specific weekly status updates toward my objectives
* [ ] Write a reader-focused post twice monthly
* [x] Make this list :) 

## Technical Goals
* [ ] Complete Gilbert Strangs Introduction to Linear Algebra
* [ ] Implement fundamental Reinforcement Learning algorithms [refinement needed]
* [ ] Implement SOTA Deep RL algorithms [e.g. PPO; refinement needed]
* [ ] Apply learned technical expertise to a monthly unique or novel problem (e.g. dont simply use existing OpenAI gyms for everything. Possibly develop new environments)

## Objectives
* Establish a commitment to progress
* Be less compulsive in my work habits by creating a steady stream of content

#### Technical Expertise
* Review of ML fundamentals, including linear algebra, calculus, and statistics
* Mastery of Reinforcement Learning concepts

#### Establish Context
* Create processes for developing technical expertise in context 
* applying a method not just to a problem, but a set of problems
* Identifying and understanding alternatives

#### Collaborate
* Develop content and projects with the assistance of others
* Contribute to projects other than my own
* Have fun along the way

## Audience (in this order)
* Me
* ML students and professionals, particularly those working at the crossroads of Reinforcement Learning and NLP
* Ancillary: professional contacts (e.g. future employers)
