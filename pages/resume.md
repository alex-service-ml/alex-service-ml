## SUMMARY

Bottom-line up front: I am an ML Engineer with a **strong desire to apply state-of-the-art research to complex problems.** 
My primary domain is in computer vision (segmentation/detection/classification), but I am looking to build expertise in 
the domains of reinforcement learning and natural language. I am most comfortable with python + pytorch

## EXPERIENCE

##### Mile Two
<font size="1">SOFTWARE ENGINEER (MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH), 2018/03 - PRESENT</font>

* Demonstrated feasibility of metric and optimization **meta-learning** on customer's imagery dataset for one-shot and 
few-shot scenarios  
* Led a team who placed 2nd and 3rd overall for Wright Brothers Institute's Swarm and Search AI (SSAI) challenge, 
as well as received an Innovation Award for our team's vision, **incorporating Deep Reinforcement Learning** (DDPG) 
into our submission by creating an OpenAI Gym API for the provided simulation software
* Incorporated **object detection** into a customer's framework. Particularly, You Only Look Twice (YOLT, a YOLO variant). 
Included building streaming interfaces to feed video to the model, slicing imagery, performing non-max suppression. 
Achieved roughly 11 FPS on 1080p imagery using a consumer-grade GPU. Supported distributing work to multiple local GPUs. 
* Wrote technical volumes for multiple proposals focused on ML-oriented projects

## PROJECTS

##### WBI/AFRL Swarm and Search AI Competition  

<font size="1">2019/05</font>

* Won 3rd place overall with a solution incorporating a mixture of classic global/local search algorithms for navigation 
and deep reinforcement learning for sensor gimbal control  
* Explored solutions utilizing particle swarm optimization and boid-like emergent behavior

##### Personal
* Trained and deployed GPT2-small to generate Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topics and research, including 
scraping and curating 27000 SBIR topics
* Completed projects for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree, including implementing classic RL algorithms 
(REINFORCE, Q-Learning) and training state-of-the-art solutions (DDPG, A2C/A3C, PPO)
