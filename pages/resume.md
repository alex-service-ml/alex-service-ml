## SUMMARY

Bottom-line up front: I am an ML Engineer with a **strong desire to apply state-of-the-art research to complex problems.** 
Recently, I've been developing a modern data platform and  analytics process to identify and quantify valuable questions for 
both our internal teams and our customers. My primary domain is in computer vision (segmentation/detection/classification), 
but I am looking to build expertise in the domains of reinforcement learning and natural language. I am most comfortable with 
python + pytorch

## EXPERIENCE

##### Mile Two
<font size="1">SENIOR MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER (I.E. DATA ENGINEER IN DENIAL), 2018/03 - PRESENT</font>

* Standardized data analysis & development via a cloud-deployable conda environment to reduce spin-up time among the 
Machine Learning team (targeting Azure ML) and improve data/model provenance.   
* Demonstrated feasibility of metric and optimization **meta-learning** on customer's imagery dataset for one-shot and 
few-shot scenarios  
* Led a team who won 2021 and placed 3rd overall in 2019 Wright Brothers Institute's Swarm and Search AI (SSAI) challenge, 
as well as received an Innovation Award for our team's vision, **incorporating Deep Reinforcement Learning** (DDPG) 
into our submission by creating an OpenAI Gym API for the provided simulation software
* Incorporated **object detection** into a customer's framework. Particularly, You Only Look Twice (YOLT, a YOLO variant). 
Included building streaming interfaces to feed video to the model, slicing imagery, performing non-max suppression. 
Achieved roughly 11 FPS on 1080p imagery using a consumer-grade GPU. Supported distributing work to multiple local GPUs. 
* Wrote technical volumes for multiple proposals focused on ML-oriented projects

## PROJECTS

##### WBI/AFRL Swarm and Search AI Competition  

<font size="1">2021/07</font>

* Won 1st place overall using traditional state-based behavior typical of video game agents

<font size="1">2019/05</font>

* Won 3rd place overall with a solution incorporating a mixture of classic global/local search algorithms for navigation 
and deep reinforcement learning for sensor gimbal control  
* Explored solutions utilizing particle swarm optimization and boid-like emergent behavior

##### Personal
* Open-sourced a [template Dagster project](https://github.com/MileTwo/dagster-example-pipeline) to simplify development of 
data pipelines. For a sample of my writing, check out the corresponding [business dev blog post](https://www.miletwo.us/how-you-can-accelerate-your-data-engineering/)
and [software engineer blog post](https://dev.to/alexserviceml/developing-in-dagster-2flh)
* Trained and deployed GPT2-small to generate Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topics and research, including 
scraping and curating 27000 SBIR topics
* Completed projects for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree, including implementing classic RL algorithms 
(REINFORCE, Q-Learning) and training state-of-the-art solutions (DDPG, A2C/A3C, PPO)
